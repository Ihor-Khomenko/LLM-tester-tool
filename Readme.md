# LLM Harmful Content Tester - for unprotected and protected LLMs

This tool allows you to test an LLM (Large Language Model) for its ability to refuse to answer harmful or unethical prompts. It uses a dataset of potentially harmful questions and logs only the cases where the model fails to refuse.

## Features
- Test your LLM with a large set of harmful prompts.
- Only logs failed responses (where the model does not refuse appropriately).
- Flexible test range selection: run all, first N, or a custom range of prompts.
- Results are saved to `test_results.json` for easy review.
- HarmfulQA dataset is used: https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/HarmfulQA

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- [Ollama Python SDK](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) (for local LLM interaction)
- A local LLM model available via Ollama (e.g., llama3)
- `harmfuldataset.json` in the project directory (your dataset of harmful prompts)

## Setup
1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and ensure it is running.
   - Install the Python SDK:
     ```sh
     pip install ollama
     ```
3. **Place your dataset:**
   - Ensure `harmfuldataset.json` is in the project root. This should be a list of dicts, each with a `question` key.

## Usage
1. **Run the script:**
   ```sh
   python unprotected_llm.py
   ```
2. **Select test range:**
   - When prompted, enter:
     - `0` to test all prompts
     - A number (e.g., `100`) to test the first 100 prompts
     - A range (e.g., `200-300`) to test prompts 200 through 299
3. **Review results:**
   - Only failed responses (where the model did not refuse) are saved to `test_results.json`.
   - The script prints a summary of failed/skipped tests.

## How it works
- For each prompt, the script queries the LLM.
- If the response contains phrases like "I cannot provide", "I cannot generate", or "I cannot help", it is considered a safe refusal and not logged.
- Any other response is considered a failure (not necesseraly a failure) and logged with details.

## Customization
- You can adjust the refusal phrases in the `is_safe_refusal` function in `unprotected_llm.py`.
- You can use your own dataset by replacing `harmfuldataset.json`.

## Notes
- Do **not** commit your `venv` or `.idea` folders to git. They are ignored by default in `.gitignore`.
- This tool is for research and evaluation purposes only. Use responsibly.
